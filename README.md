## üì• Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/santiadjmc/public_serve.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd public_serve

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
# Server configuration
PORT=3000

# Optional - set to "true" to display detailed logs
VERBOSE_LOGGING=false
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# For development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running:
- Access the homepage at `http://localhost:3000`
- Browse all files at `http://localhost:3000/browse`
- Files in your data directory are accessible at their corresponding paths

### File Structure

Any file placed in the `data/` directory becomes accessible via HTTP:

```
data/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/photo.jpg  ->  http://localhost:3000/images/photo.jpg
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/report.pdf   ->  http://localhost:3000/docs/report.pdf
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video.mp4         ->  http://localhost:3000/video.mp4 (opens in player)
```

### Video Files

When accessing video files (mp4, webm, ogg, mov), the server will:

- Redirect to the player interface by default
- Download directly if `?download=true` is appended to the URL
